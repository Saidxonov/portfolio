            Hello, my name is Said. I study at Najot Talim Fergana branch. I
            have been taking Frontend Web Programming course since 3 months, I
            have many friends and brothers who teach me what I don't know. I
            study in the FN28 group, but the downside is that my school doesn't
            coincide with the start of my course, so I have to start the FN29
            course soon, but I don't want to leave my friends and acquaintances.
            My class starts at 8:30 in the morning, and we will learn how to
            burn a little bit from a qualified teacher, Ahror Soliev. Every day
            after class, I enter the coworking area and prepare my lessons. I
            have organized a lot in these 3 months. First of all, I would like
            to thank my parents, if they hadn't been there, if they hadn't
            recommended me to come here, I wouldn't be here now. Because of
            them, I can find a little place in life now. They also gave me a
            powerful laptop to study this field. In addition, they gave a lot of
            things, for example, one of them is a wireless earphone, why do you
            need it? You mean, because when I was preparing a lesson, I used to
            get depressed when my code didn't look like it, but now I like it
            because when I listen to music, my mistakes seem to motivate me.
            That's why I move forward, if something doesn't look right, I look
            for my mistakes, but before I used to get depressed. Another one of
            them was glasses, they gave me glasses so that my eyes wouldn't get
            hurt. Now I prepare a lesson using these glasses. In this way, God
            willing, I will become a great person in the future. Thank you for
            your attention
